## Note

The MTO-Platform (MToP) has incorporated the relevant algorithm at *"MTO/Algorithms/Single-task/Constraint Handling/CCEF-ECHT/CCEF_ECHT.m"* and provides convenient utility functions. We highly recommend using it for code running. [https://github.com/intLyc/MTO-Platform](https://github.com/intLyc/MTO-Platform)
